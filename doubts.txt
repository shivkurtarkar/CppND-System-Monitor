isnt it better to ne value 

vector<string> LinuxParser::CpuUtilization() { 
    single and multi

best way to pass multiple values from function



Hey I have few quetions
In linux_parser file there is a function
vector<string> LinuxParser::CpuUtilization() 
which i suppose is to parse /proc/stat
and use in float Processor::Utilization() 
to compute aggregate cpu Utilization.
is this arrangement for if i want to pass multiple cpu info?
or is it like i am supposed to pass 10 values of aggreatate cpu stat?
cpu  49733 101 12294 1270995 35109 1472 1846 0 0 0
if so isnt it a bad idea to pass values as vector which is dynamic
and values are known to be 10 shouldnt it be array?
what are the best ways of passing multiple values in c++?
is map of key value a overkill for the work since it does sorting and stuff?
